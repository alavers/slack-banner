flf2a 7 5 10 -1 17
Alphabet by Wendell Hicken 11/93 (whicken@parasoft.com)

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
20   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
12   - number of comment lines

---

Font modified June 17, 2007 by patorjk 
This was to widen the space character.
